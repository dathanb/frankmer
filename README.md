# TeaTicker

A simple command line timer built with Rust. As the name suggests, the primary use of this project is timing how long my tea has steeped for...

It uses FIGlet fonts, and the standard library `time` package for the timings, and then the fabulous `crossterm` and `clap` Crates for the CLI and terminal handling.
